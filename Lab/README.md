# EyeSpy Lab Setup

This repository includes a **lab environment configuration** for testing EyeSpy with simulated RTSP streams.

🧪 This setup uses tools like `ffmpeg`, `IPCameraEmulatorSTD.exe`, and `MediaMTX` to create a set of RTSP cameras — both unauthenticated and authenticated — for experimentation and validation.

## Quick Summary

In this lab you will configure:

- A **no-authentication RTSP stream** (default port 554)
- A **digest authentication RTSP stream**
- Optional additional streams for basic authentication
- Tools for inspecting and interacting with the streams

This environment is ideal for **learning, development, and controlled testing** of EyeSpy.

## Full Setup Instructions

The full step-by-step lab setup, including prerequisites, software installation, stream configuration, and troubleshooting, is documented in the **EyeSpy Wiki**:
